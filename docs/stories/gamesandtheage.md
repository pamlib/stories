*Wth it said I have mental health issues?*

Scott was a young man with a passion for video games. He spent most of his free time playing with his two best friends, Nate and Shawn. The three of them had been inseparable since they were kids, and their love for gaming only continued to grow as they got older.

Scott was the leader of their little group, always coming up with new strategies and game plans for them to try out. Nate was the resident expert on all things technical, always able to fix any issues they encountered with their equipment. Shawn was the wild card, always coming up with crazy ideas and willing to take risks that the other two would never consider.

Together, they were a force to be reckoned with in the world of online gaming. They spent hours upon hours in front of their screens, honing their skills and rising through the ranks of the most popular games.

But as they got older, the demands of real life started to intrude on their gaming time. Scott began to focus more on his studies, while Nate started to work part-time to help support his family. Shawn, meanwhile, struggled with mental health issues that made it difficult for him to stay focused on the games.

Despite the challenges they faced, Scott and his friends never lost their love for gaming. They continued to play together whenever they could, and their bond only grew stronger as a result. In the end, their shared passion for video games brought them closer together, and they remained the best of friends for life.
