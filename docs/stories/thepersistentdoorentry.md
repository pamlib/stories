SCP-XXXX: The Persistent Door

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-XXXX is to be contained in a standard anomalous object locker at Site-17. Access to SCP-XXXX is restricted to Level 3 personnel and above, and all experimentation must be approved by Level 4 personnel.

SCP-XXXX is a wooden door measuring 2.1 meters in height and 1 meter in width. The door exhibits no unusual physical properties, and appears to be made of standard oak wood.

The anomalous property of SCP-XXXX becomes apparent when it is closed. Any person attempting to open the door from the outside will be unable to do so, regardless of the method used. This includes using mechanical devices such as crowbars or hydraulic jacks, as well as supernatural means such as telekinesis or magical spells.

However, anyone inside the room the door leads to will be able to open the door normally. This allows individuals to enter the room, but prevents them from leaving unless they have previously entered the room through another means.

SCP-XXXX has shown no sign of wear or damage despite being used regularly for over 50 years. It is currently unknown how the door is able to maintain its anomalous properties, or how it is able to resist damage.

SCP-XXXX was originally discovered in a abandoned mental asylum in [REDACTED], after reports of individuals becoming trapped inside. Foundation agents were able to locate and contain the door, and all individuals trapped inside were successfully extracted.

Further testing is ongoing to determine the full extent of SCP-XXXX's anomalous properties and potential uses.

Note: SCP-XXXX has proven to be a valuable asset in containing certain SCP objects, as it allows personnel to enter and retrieve the object without risk of escape. However, caution must be exercised when using SCP-XXXX, as it can also potentially trap personnel inside if the door is not properly secured.
