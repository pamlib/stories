The Foundation first became aware of SCP-XXXX when reports started trickling in of individuals becoming trapped inside a seemingly ordinary door at an abandoned mental asylum. Upon investigation, Foundation agents discovered that the door, made of standard oak wood and measuring 2.1 meters in height and 1 meter in width, exhibited anomalous properties.

Any person attempting to open the door from the outside was unable to do so, no matter what method they used. This included the use of mechanical devices such as crowbars or hydraulic jacks, as well as supernatural means like telekinesis or magic spells. However, anyone inside the room that the door led to was able to open it normally. This meant that individuals could enter the room, but couldn't leave unless they had previously entered through another means.

Despite being used regularly for over 50 years, SCP-XXXX showed no signs of wear or damage. It was unclear how the door was able to maintain its anomalous properties or resist damage.

The Foundation contained SCP-XXXX and extracted all individuals who had become trapped inside. Further testing is ongoing to determine the full extent of its anomalous properties and potential uses.

SCP-XXXX has proven to be a valuable asset in containing certain SCP objects, as it allows personnel to enter and retrieve the object without the risk of escape. However, caution must be exercised when using SCP-XXXX, as it can also potentially trap personnel inside if the door is not properly secured. It is currently contained in a standard anomalous object locker at Site-17, and access is restricted to Level 3 personnel and above. All experimentation must be approved by Level 4 personnel.

One of the first experiments conducted on SCP-XXXX was to determine if there were any limits to its ability to prevent external opening. A team of Foundation agents attempted to open the door using a variety of methods, ranging from brute force to sophisticated mechanical devices.

The results were consistent: no matter what method was used, the door remained firmly shut. Even when subjected to extreme force, such as a hydraulic press or explosives, the door showed no signs of damage.

It was also discovered that any objects placed on the threshold of the door, such as a chair or a bar, would become immovable once the door was closed. This suggested that SCP-XXXX had some sort of field or aura that prevented objects from being moved in or out.

Further testing was conducted to determine if there were any ways to bypass the anomalous properties of SCP-XXXX. It was found that the only way to open the door from the outside was to first enter the room through another means, such as a window or a second door. Once inside, the door could be opened and closed normally.

This led to the development of special containment procedures for SCP-XXXX, including the requirement that all personnel entering the room must do so through another means in order to prevent accidental trapping. It was also recommended that at least two people be present when working with SCP-XXXX, in case one person became trapped inside and needed assistance.

Despite these precautions, several incidents have occurred where personnel have become trapped inside the room due to an oversight or mistake. In all cases, the individuals were successfully extracted, but the Foundation has learned to exercise caution when working with SCP-XXXX.

Further study of SCP-XXXX revealed that it had some unique properties that made it particularly useful for containing certain anomalous objects. One such object was SCP-████, a living creature that was capable of phasing through solid matter.

SCP-████ had proven to be extremely difficult to contain, as it was able to escape any enclosure that was built for it. However, when placed in the room with SCP-XXXX, it became completely contained. It was theorized that the aura or field surrounding the door prevented SCP-████ from phasing through the walls, effectively trapping it in the room.

This discovery led to the use of SCP-XXXX in the containment of other SCP objects that were difficult to contain, such as SCP-███, a humanoid that was able to teleport short distances, and SCP-███, a shape-shifting creature. In all cases, SCP-XXXX was able to effectively contain the anomalous objects, providing a valuable resource for the Foundation.

However, the use of SCP-XXXX in containment was not without its risks. On several occasions, containment breaches occurred when personnel accidentally left the door open, allowing the contained SCP object to escape. In one instance, SCP-███ was able to shape-shift into a copy of one of the containment personnel, leading to a widespread search before it was eventually recaptured.

As a result, strict protocols were put in place for the use of SCP-XXXX in containment, including the requirement for multiple personnel to be present at all times and the use of specialized lock systems to prevent accidental opening of the door. Despite these measures, the Foundation remains cautious when working with SCP-XXXX, recognizing the potential risks it presents.
